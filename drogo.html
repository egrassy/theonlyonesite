          <p>
            In the vast and often serious world of cryptocurrencies, a new
            project emerges that stands out from other blockchain adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome to Project DROGO, where a dragon named DROGO defends its
            treasure not through fiery breath or epic battles, but, well, by
            doing absolutely nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, it’s a crypto dragon that lounges around, and its motto is
            simple: “Dragon’s protecting its Cosmos treasure on Terra also, by
            doing nothing just as a meme coin.”
          </p>
          <p>What’s the deal with DROGO, you ask?</p>
          <p>
            Imagine a dragon not as a mighty and fearsome creature as you would
            expect, but as a laid-back and gentle friend who defends its
            treasure with the philosophy of “Hands Off.”
          </p>
          <p>
            DROGO has decided to bypass the serious life and has embraced a
            meme-style approach, becoming a meme token in the TERRA ecosystem
            and a child of TheOnlyOne DAO.

          <h2 class="fs-800">The DROGO Experience:</h2>
          <p>
            DROGO is not your typical cryptocurrency; it’s a full-fledged comedy
            show in the blockchain world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project aims to bring joy, laughter, and a dash of absurdity to
            the cryptocurrency community. DROGO, inspired by the concept of a
            mother dragon, doesn’t bother with complex features or grand plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its value lies in simplicity and the joy of being part of something
            amusing.

          <h2 class="fs-800">Tokenomics — Division of the Treasure:</h2>
          <p>
            DROGO can boast a total supply of 960 billion, but here’s where the
            real fun begins:
          </p>
          <p>
            - Liquidity Pool (29%): Approximately 278.4 billion DROGO tokens
            will be added to the liquidity pool with XXX token. It’s like adding
            spices to the crypto stew — you never know what deliciousness might
            come out of it!
          </p>
          <p>
            - TheOnlyOne DAO Participants (10%): Active participants in
            TheOnlyOne DAO will get around 96 billion DROGO tokens. It’s like a
            bonus for being part of the favorite sitcom of the crypto community.
          </p>
          <p>
            - TheOnlyOne DAO Treasury (61%): A whopping 585.6 billion DROGO
            tokens will be stashed in the treasury of TheOnlyOne DAO, ready to
            fund future projects. The dragon can chill, but the treasury is
            gearing up for serious matters!
